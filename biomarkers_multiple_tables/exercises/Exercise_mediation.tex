\noindent {\bf TASK 1 - Mediation analysis:} File {\tt diet2.dta} is a Stata database including information about several diseases and confounding variables (columns 1-16), nutrients (columns 17-26) and food consumption (columns 27-48). 

\smallskip

\noindent Open an R Mardown document and perform the following tasks by writting comments to each step
 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Load data into R and save the information in an object called {\tt diet}.
 \item Let us imagine that researchers are interested in determining those nutrients and foods that are associated with colorectal cancer (variable {\tt cacoc}). Create another database called {\tt diet.cc} removing missing of variable {\tt casoc}
 
 \begin{verbatim}
 diet.cc <- diet[!is.na(diet$casoc),]
 \end{verbatim}
 
  \item Create a table describing whether patient's characteristics are comparable among cases and controls (variables {\tt edad,  sexo, estudios, peso, altura, mets\_10a, mets\_5a, Diabetes, Hipertensio, Colesterol}). NOTE: use the function {\tt export2md} to get a nice table into the .html output.  
  
 \item Create a table computing OR for control vs colorectal cancer for all variables but: {\tt id, tipocancer, casom, casop, casoe}. NOTE: use the function {\tt export2md} to get a nice table into the .html output. 
 
 \item Perform mediation analysis considering colesterol as a mediator of the association observed between consumption of processed meat (variable {\tt gra\_conveniencefood}) and colorectal cancer (variable {\tt casoc}). NOTE: adjust the models by {\tt sexo}, {\tt t\_energy}, {\tt BMIhoy} and {\tt edad}.
 \end{enumerate}
