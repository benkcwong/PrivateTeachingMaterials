\noindent {\bf TASK 1 - Comparing two DAGs:} Load data called {\tt diet.Rdata} by executing 

\begin{verbatim}
load(''data_exercises/diet.Rdata'')
\end{verbatim}

\noindent There are three databases called X1, X2 and X3. X1 contains outcome and confounding variables. X2 contains nutriens and X3 contains food consumption. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which is the likelihood of this DAG?

\item Which is the best DAG that fits this data ({\tt mydat})?

\begin{verbatim}
vars1 <- c("casoc", "sexo", "peso", "mets_10a", "Colesterol")
X <- cbind(X1[, vars1],  X3[,1:6])
mydat <- X[complete.cases(X),]
names(mydat)
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
